# Daily ML & EDA Practice (Kaggle Datasets)

This repository documents my **daily consistency practice** in **Machine Learning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **diverse Kaggle datasets**.

## What’s Inside
-**EDA Pipelines** – data cleaning, visualization, insights  
- **ML Models** – baseline to optimized models  
- **Experiments** – feature engineering and model comparison  
- **Progress Tracking** – one dataset, one commit every day  

## 🎯 Goal
To build strong **data intuition**, improve **modeling skills**, and maintain **daily consistency** through hands-on practice.

## Commitment
> **Daily commits. Continuous learning. Real-world datasets.**
